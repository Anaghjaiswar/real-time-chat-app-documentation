## Overview

The backend is built using Django, Django REST Framework, and Django Channels for real-time communication. We use DRF token-based authentication for REST and WebSocket connections. For the channel layer in production, we use Redis (or for development/in a small scale, the In-Memory Channel Layer).

**Production URL:**  
`csi-backend-wvn0.onrender.com`

---

## Authentication

- **Method:** Token-based authentication via Django REST Framework.
- **Obtaining a Token:**  
  Use the login API (not detailed here) to obtain a token. The token must be included in both REST API requests (in the `Authorization` header) and WebSocket connections (via query params).
  

**For WebSocket connections, include the token in the URL:**

---

## WebSocket Connection

### Endpoint URL

The WebSocket endpoint follows this pattern:
`ws://csi-backend-wvn0.onrender.com/ws/chat/<room_id>/?token=<your-auth-token>`

- **`<room_id>`:** Use one of the valid room id's (e.g., `5`, `6`, etc.).
- **`<your-auth-token>`:** The token obtained after authenticating via the login API.
- also after <room_name> in url , then you can put token through params in key value pair key-- `token` and value will be `your auth token` 

### Kotlin Example

Hereâ€™s a sample Kotlin snippet to connect to the WebSocket:

```kotlin
import okhttp3.OkHttpClient
import okhttp3.Request
import okhttp3.WebSocket
import okhttp3.WebSocketListener
import okio.ByteString

val client = OkHttpClient()

val token = "934dc28f497f315b24966dbc5c72a9bded24d0e7"
val roomId = 5
val wsUrl = "ws://csi-backend-wvn0.onrender.com/ws/chat/$roomId/?token=$token"

val request = Request.Builder()
    .url(wsUrl)
    .build()

val webSocketListener = object : WebSocketListener() {
    override fun onOpen(webSocket: WebSocket, response: okhttp3.Response) {
        println("Connected to WebSocket")
        // Example: Send a message when connected
        webSocket.send("""{"message": "Hello, world!", "message_type": "text"}""")  // you don't need to send message_type as by default we assume it to be text type
    }

    override fun onMessage(webSocket: WebSocket, text: String) {
        println("Received message: $text")
    }

    override fun onMessage(webSocket: WebSocket, bytes: ByteString) {
        println("Received bytes: ${bytes.hex()}")
    }

    override fun onClosing(webSocket: WebSocket, code: Int, reason: String) {
        println("Closing WebSocket: $code / $reason")
        webSocket.close(1000, null)
    }

    override fun onFailure(webSocket: WebSocket, t: Throwable, response: okhttp3.Response?) {
        println("WebSocket error: ${t.message}")
    }
}

val webSocket = client.newWebSocket(request, webSocketListener)
// Shutdown the client when done:
client.dispatcher.executorService.shutdown()
```
Note: This example uses OkHttp. Adjust as needed if you use a different WebSocket library.


## Testing Guidelines

### WebSocket Testing
- **Tools:** Use tools such as Postman or a simple Kotlin client (see the provided Kotlin example) to test WebSocket connectivity.
- **Checklist:**
  - Verify that a WebSocket connection is successfully established when a valid token is provided.
  - Test sending messages over the WebSocket and ensure that messages are correctly received and broadcast to all connected clients.

### Additional Information

remember few things- 
1. when you click on send message button it should trigger the websocket connect option
2. if successfully connected your message will be sent, and you will receive the following details:-
--- if you send this
```
{
    "action" : "send_message",
    "message": "hello everyone",
    "message_type": "text"
}
```
you will get --

```
{
    "message": "hello everyone", // the message 
    "sender": {
        "name": "Anagh", //first name
        "photo": "http://res.cloudinary.com/dcbla9zbl/image/upload/v1739107362/lwfugihthelebahq8pbz.jpg", //  photo by default null
        "id": 1, // id of the sender 
        "role": "member" // role of the sender admin or member
    }, // sender details
    "message_type": "text", // message type
    "id": 43, // id of message
    "attachment": null, // attachment sending will be done through HTTPS
    "created_at": "2025-02-15T17:07:32.256110+00:00", // timestamps of the message 
    "room": "2nd_year" // the message belongs to which room
}
```
--- if you want to edit the message you need to send 
```
{
    "action": "edit_message",
    "new_content": "hello csi members of 2nd year",
    "message_id": 43
}
```
you will get 
```
{
    "action": "edited",
    "id": 43,
    "new_content": "hello csi members of 2nd year"
}
```

--- if you want to react to message you need to send 
```
{
    "action" : "react_message",
    "message_id" : 43,
    "reaction" : "Like"
}
```
you will get 
```
{
    "action": "reacted",
    "id": 43,
    "reactions": {
        "Like": 1
    }
}
```
--- if you want to mention anyone from the group you have to send 
```
{
    "action": "send_message",
    "message": "hello @achal and @sparsh",
    "message_type": "text", 
    "mentions" : [13, 15] // id's of the respective members whom you have mentioned
}
```
you will get a normal message like this 
```
{
    "message": "hello @achal and @sparsh",
    "sender": {
        "name": "Anagh",
        "photo": "http://res.cloudinary.com/dcbla9zbl/image/upload/v1739107362/lwfugihthelebahq8pbz.jpg",
        "id": 1,
        "role": "member"
    },
    "message_type": "text",
    "id": 62,
    "attachment": null,
    "created_at": "2025-02-16T06:30:39.461351+00:00",
    "room": "2nd_year"
}
 but in database the mentions will be saved so whenever you open that group again and call the api (see_old_messages_of_that_group) you will get the information of mentioned people id's 
```
--- if you want to delete the message 
``` 
{
    "action" : "delete_message",
    "message_id" : 59
}
```
you will get 
```
{
    "action": "deleted",
    "id": 59
}
```



3 - only the person which belongs to that group or room can send message in that room.
4 - only the person who has send the message can edit or delete his message , no one else.
5 - you can mention only those users who have joined that particular group.
6 - this way multiple users can simultaneously talk to each other in any group.
7 - (in real - time only messaging, editing and deleting a message, mentioning anyone in a message is to be done through websockets request).
8 - when you leave that room disconnect from it.

a important postman api will help in fetching old messages of any particular group 
post request to `https://csi-backend-wvn0.onrender.com/api/chat/groups/group_id/messages/`
you can refer to postman for that 
a sample response will be 
```

# Typing Notification

This document provides the details for handling real-time typing notifications via WebSocket in the chat application. It outlines the JSON messages that the frontend should send when a user is typing or stops typing, as well as the expected JSON response from the backend.

---

## Typing Notification Overview

When a user starts typing in a chat room, the frontend should send a specific JSON payload to notify the backend. Similarly, when the user stops typing, another JSON payload is sent. The backend will then broadcast a corresponding message to all connected clients in the room, allowing the UI to display or hide a typing indicator (e.g., "User X is typing...").

---

## JSON Messages

### 1. Sending a "Typing" Event

**When the user starts typing, send:**

```json
{
  "action": "typing"
}
```
#### Expected Broadcast Response:

All clients in the room will receive:

```json
{
  "action": "typing",
  "sender": {
    "name": "UserFirstName",
    "photo": "http://example.com/photo.jpg",  // May be null if not available
    "id": 1,
    "role": "member"  // or "admin"
  },
  "is_typing": true
}
```
### 2. Sending a "Stop Typing" Event
When the user stops typing (or after a short period of inactivity), send:

```json
{
  "action": "stop_typing"
}
```
#### Expected Broadcast Response:

All clients in the room will receive:
```json
{
  "action": "typing",
  "sender": {
    "name": "UserFirstName",
    "photo": "http://example.com/photo.jpg",
    "id": 1,
    "role": "member"
  },
  "is_typing": false
}
```

## How It Works

### User Starts Typing:

1. The frontend sends the "typing" event.
2. The backend receives this event and broadcasts a JSON message to all clients in the room with `"is_typing": true`.
3. The frontend UI should then display an indicator (e.g., "UserFirstName is typing...").

### User Stops Typing:

1. The frontend sends the "stop_typing" event after detecting inactivity (e.g., after 500ms of no input).
2. The backend broadcasts a JSON message with `"is_typing": false` to all clients.
3. The UI should remove or hide the typing indicator accordingly.

## Additional Notes

### Connection Requirement:

Ensure the WebSocket connection is established before sending any typing events.

### Debouncing:

Implement a debounce mechanism on the frontend to prevent excessive sending of typing events. For example, send a "stop_typing" event after 500ms of inactivity.

### Multiple Users:

When multiple users are typing, the backend will broadcast a separate JSON message for each user. The frontend should be capable of displaying multiple typing indicators (e.g., "User1 and User2 are typing...").

---

## Typing  implementation (for achal specially)

When a user starts typing, the frontend sends a WebSocket message with the `typing` action. The backend then broadcasts to all clients in that room, and they update the UI to show a typing indicator (e.g., "User X is typing..."). The same applies when the user stops typing.

### Client-Side Implementation
--- Sending Typing Events
Triggering the Event:

When the user begins typing, send a JSON payload to notify the server. When they stop typing, send a stop event.

Example Function:
```
import com.google.gson.Gson

val gson = Gson()

fun sendTypingEvent(webSocket: WebSocket, isTyping: Boolean) {
    val event = mapOf("action" to if (isTyping) "typing" else "stop_typing")
    val jsonData = gson.toJson(event)
    webSocket.send(jsonData)
}
```

### Debouncing:
To avoid flooding the server with events, implement debouncing. For example, using Kotlin Coroutines:

```
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

var typingJob: Job? = null

fun onUserTyping(webSocket: WebSocket) {
    typingJob?.cancel()
    // Send the typing event immediately
    sendTypingEvent(webSocket, true)
    // Schedule a stop_typing event after 500ms of inactivity
    typingJob = GlobalScope.launch {
        delay(500)
        sendTypingEvent(webSocket, false)
    }
}
```

Integrate onUserTyping into your text input listener so it triggers whenever the user types.

### Receiving Typing Notifications
Handling the Broadcast:
In your WebSocket listener's onMessage callback, check for the typing action and update the UI accordingly.
```
override fun onMessage(webSocket: WebSocket, text: String) {
    println("Received: $text")
    try {
        val jsonObj = JSONObject(text)
        if (jsonObj.getString("action") == "typing") {
            val isTyping = jsonObj.getBoolean("is_typing")
            val sender = jsonObj.getJSONObject("sender")
            val senderName = sender.getString("name")
            if (isTyping) {
                showTypingIndicator(senderName)
            } else {
                hideTypingIndicator(senderName)
            }
        }
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        e.printStackTrace()
    }
}
```
### UI Updates:
showTypingIndicator(senderName: String): Display a UI element (e.g., a TextView) indicating "senderName is typing...".
hideTypingIndicator(senderName: String): Remove or hide the typing indicator when the user stops typing.
### Handling Multiple Users:
If more than one user is typing, combine their names into a single message like "User1, User2 are typing...".
Testing the Typing Notification

### Verify Debouncing:
Ensure that the "stop_typing" event is sent only after the user has paused typing for the specified delay (e.g., 500ms).
UI Verification:

Confirm that the typing indicator appears when a "typing" event is received and disappears when a "stop_typing" event is received.
